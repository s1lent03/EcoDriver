# Eco Driver

Eco Driver is a semi-realistic driving simulator, developed with the purpose of helping people that are getting their driver's license. The semi-realism comes in the way the car drives (example: it takes the gears of a manual car into account), and not in the physics of the car itself.

## Mechanics

### Driving

To drive the car, the player has to take the clutch and gears into account, both working similar to a real life vehicle.

### Traffic Violations

The game also detects traffic violations like speeding, not stopping at STOP or Traffic Lights and others. These are all saved into variables and shown to the player at the end of each game session.

In addition to showing the traffic violations, it also shows the distance traveled and a very rough estimate of the emissions of the vehicle.

### Controllers

The game is designed to work with a normal PS4/PS5 or Xbox Gamepad, but also with a Logitech G29 Wheel and Pedals. The controller's triggers help with the clutch and accelerator realism, while the G29 enchances it even more by making it feel more like the player is really driving a car.
